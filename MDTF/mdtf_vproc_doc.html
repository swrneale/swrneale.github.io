ENSO Vertical Processes (ENSO_VERT_PROC) diagnostic package consists of five levels. With a
focus on identifying leading processes that determine ENSO-induced global teleconnection,
particularly the Pacific North American (PNA) pattern, main module of the POD estimates tendencies
in vertical processes (e.g., moisture and temperature) along the equatorial western-central-eastern
Pacific, east Asian monsoon, subtropical North Pacific and South Pacific. During ENSO evolution,
vertical processes (e.g., diabatic heating and associated upper-level divergence) in these regions are
identified as important for forcing and the generation of barotropic stationary Rossby waves that are
regarded as the principal agent in anchoring the mid-high latitude circulation anomalies during ENSO.
In that pursuit, POD is applied to monthly data (climate model or reanalysis products), and
VERT_PROC tendencies are estimated for “composite” El Niño or La Nina events. To attain robust
“composite” results a reasonable sample of ENSO winters is needed. However, the POD can be applied
even for a single El Niño winter (e.g., when applied to seasonal prediction models). Here, reanalysis
products (e.g., ERA-interim) is “considered” as “observations” and diagnostics obtained from ERA-
Interim and other reanalysis products are used for model validation. In this general document, brief
descriptions of the FOUR levels of the POD are provided but detailed information is provided at each
level. For the FOUR levels of diagnostics, selected results are illustrated here.
POD works efficiently if model data contain sufficient number of El Niño or La Nina events.
Predigested results are available for both El Niño and La Nina composites.

Vertical Processes POD to assess ENSO-induced teleconnection (ENSO_VERT_PROC)
The NOAA-MDTF Vertical Processes Diagnostic package would fill a critical gap in the diagnostics
tools available to climate model developers. Both in basic-state and anomalous conditions, changes in
the response of moist processes in model either parameterization modifications or tuning and
calibration, can often change the nature of the seasonal distributions of tropical precipitation and
associated heating, and by association moistening and divergence profiles. While validation of
precipitation is straightforward, an understanding of the circulation consequences in the tropics, and
particularly the extra-tropics is not. RICH MORE SPECIFIC POINTS?
