<hr>
ENSO Vertical Processes (ENSO_VERT_PROC) diagnostic package consists of FOUR levels. With a
focus on identifying leading processes that determine ENSO-induced global teleconnection,
particularly the Pacific North American (PNA) pattern, main module of the POD estimates tendencies
in vertical processes (e.g., moisture and temperature) along the equatorial western-central-eastern
Pacific, east Asian monsoon, subtropical North Pacific and South Pacific. During ENSO evolution,
vertical processes (e.g., diabatic heating and associated upper-level divergence) in these regions are
identified as important for forcing and the generation of barotropic stationary Rossby waves that are
regarded as the principal agent in anchoring the mid-high latitude circulation anomalies during ENSO.
In that pursuit, POD is applied to monthly data (climate model or reanalysis products), and
VERT_PROC tendencies are estimated for “composite” El Niño or La Nina events. To attain robust
“composite” results a reasonable sample of ENSO winters is needed. However, the POD can be applied
even for a single El Niño winter (e.g., when applied to seasonal prediction models). Here, reanalysis
products (e.g., ERA-interim) is “considered” as “observations” and diagnostics obtained from ERA-
Interim and other reanalysis products are used for model validation. In this general document, brief
descriptions of the FOUR levels of the POD are provided but detailed information is provided at each
level. For the FOUR levels of diagnostics, selected results are illustrated here.
POD works efficiently if model data contain sufficient number of El Niño or La Nina events.
Predigested results are available for both El Niño and La Nina composites.

Vertical Processes POD to assess ENSO-induced teleconnection (ENSO_VERT_PROC)
The NOAA-MDTF Vertical Processes Diagnostic package would fill a critical gap in the diagnostics
tools available to climate model developers. Both in basic-state and anomalous conditions, changes in
the response of moist processes in model either parameterization modifications or tuning and
calibration, can often change the nature of the seasonal distributions of tropical precipitation and
associated heating, and by association moistening and divergence profiles. While validation of
precipitation is straightforward, an understanding of the circulation consequences in the tropics, and
particularly the extra-tropics is not. RICH MORE SPECIFIC POINTS?

More specifically, generation of Rossby wave sources crucially depend on upper-level divergence and
divergent winds (advective), and vertical mass flux. These upper-tropospheric processes in the deep
tropics are complex that depend on interactions among multiple parameterizations. The VERT_PROC
POD developed here will help to address this critical validation gap, by assessing both climatological
and anomalous processes in the vertical that are relevant to the generation of upper-level divergence
and divergent winds. This will be particularly important in coupled configuration development, since
changes to the atmosphere model configuration can lead to complex coupled feedback modifying not
only the mean climate, but the response during ENSO events.

Few take home messages to model development include: 
 Climatological heating properties (e.g., top-heavy vs bottom-heavy heating maxima)
 Vertical characteristics of vertical velocity/divergence/convergence maxima (principal Rossby
wave sources location and intensity)
 Vertical tendency terms of moisture and temperature (INFERENCE)

Level 1 – Basic ENSO diagnostics
Identify ENSO winters and construct seasonal composite anomalies for relevant variables (e.g., vertical
profiles of anomalous divergence, vertical velocity, moisture, temperature etc.,) for regions of interest.
Reference index (e.g., Nino3.4 SST)
 Seasonal averages
Based on a reference ENSO index (e.g., area-averaged SST anomalies over Nino3.4 region), seasonal
composites of vertical structures of relevant variables are constructed. Fig. 1 shows composite
anomalous precipitation (shaded), 200hPa divergence/convergence (contour/hatching) and 200hPa
divergent wind (vector) for boreal winter (DJF) season during El Niño constructed from GFDL-AM4
AMIP simulations performed for the period 1980-2014 (Fig. 1a) and ERA-interim (Fig. 1b).

Level 2 – Climatological diagnostics
Climate models’ climatological or basic state vertical profiles imprint on the simulated anomalous
structures, and subsequently on ENSO-induced teleconnection. Specifically, models are required to
accurately represent different convective regimes along the equatorial Pacific (e.g., deep circulation
with a broad maximum through the mid-troposphere illustrating deep convection prevalence over the
equatorial central Pacific, and bottom-heavy or shallow circulation associated with shallow convection
over the eastern equatorial Pacific). Similarly, climatological vertical structures over the subtropical
North Pacific and equatorial western Pacific/Maritime Continent, regions corresponding to anomalous
descending limbs of local Hadley and planetary Walker circulations, determine the strength and
location of anomalous RWS.

Level 4: Comparison among model development versions
In this POD, we have included a higher level of diagnostics (LEVEL_04) that is only relevant to
comparison among &quot;model development versions&quot;. A few example plots for CAM5 to CAM6
development versions (pseudo) are shown. These plots are made to provide a quantification of
improvements/degradations from previous iterations of model development versions. RICH – insights
into model parameterizations????
